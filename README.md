## What is this? 
This is a linktree template i originally made for a friend but have decided to publish it on Github for anyone to use, you're welcome! 


## How to use 
Open index.html in a text editor of your choice, search for "CHANGE TITLE PAGE" and "ADD YOUR LINKS HERE" text using ctrl + f or command + f, you will need update these to reflect your own content. 

You will also need to replace the text "Jane Doe" and "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.", this is just generic space filling text. 

Your profile picture image should be called "profilepicture.png" or edit the html document to use whichever filename you prefer, don't forget to either upload your profile picture in the images folder or edit the html document path to your picture location.
